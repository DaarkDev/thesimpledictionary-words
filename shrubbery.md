# Not another shrubbery! (Phrase)

Definition: Saying something has happened again; basically replace shrubbery with whatever word fits the situation. 

Root: This comes from the film "Monty Python and the Holy Grail" (please note that not all views in the film are supported, 
in fact some are denounced). This particular usage of the phrase is new.

Example: Jamie is looking through the store and sees many sections with lipstick. When she sees one she says "*Not another __shrubbery__!*"
