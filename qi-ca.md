# Qi Ca

Definition: A greeting of sorts, said cheerily. It is not sarcastic and used to alert presence politely with an
implied positive connotation.

Roots: "Qi" is technically a greeting word, but it would be improper to use it alone. "Ca" is an affirmative question, basically saying "right?". 
When you say "Qi Ca" you are literally saying: {greeting, right?}. A good response would be "Ca sir" (Affirmative indeed). A simple "Lessa" (yes) would 
do just fine as a response too.

Example: You could use it when meeting up with a friend
as an polite informal greeting.

Usage:

Person 1: "*__Qi Ca__, Jack!*"
Person 2: "*Ca sir!*"
