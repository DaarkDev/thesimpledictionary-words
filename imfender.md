# Imfender

Definition: Someone who slaps the phrase "no offense, but.." before every insult as an
excuse to mock or patronize someone, and expects them not to take offense somehow.

Roots: "offender" (one who makes another take offense), and the prefix "im" meaning not.

Example: Gin told me not to take offense,
but then he insulted me with a racial slur!

Usage:

Person 1: "*No offense, but you look really stupid.*"

What they expect person 2 to say: "*None taken! Thanks for letting me know.*"
What they actually say: "*You are such an __imfender__. Do you even care about my feelings?*:
Person 1: "*Of course not. Now go back to your corner, peasant.*"
