## Vop

Definition: Saying someone is being mean, and should stop it. Also can be used as an indication
of annoyance, nuisance, hamper, or other negative conotation. This is an implied/discreet method
of making such feelings known to the person.

Example: Gary asked Bill to vop it, because he was pushing the line.

Usage:

Person 1: "*You really need to lose weight Laura.*"
Person 2 (Laura): "*Just __vop.__*"
