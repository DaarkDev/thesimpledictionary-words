## Qi

Definition: A word that means "Hello" or a greeting, but it is improper to use it alone. 
It is used in other phrases (such as "Qi Ca"). It can also be used as a verb in some cases, 
if you are telling someone to greet. E.g. "Go qi (greet) them". However, you cannot just say "Qi" as Hi or hello.

Example: Samuel went to __qi__ the people joining his party.

Usage: 

Person 1: "*__Qi__(greet) people to comfort*."
