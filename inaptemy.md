# Inaptemy

Definition: An enemy who is not apt for you. This could be because they are unqualified compared
to you thus making you look superior, or they may be irrelevant in some way.

Roots: "In" (meaning not), "apt" (meaning relative or qualified), "enemy" (someone against you).

Example: Carlos was an __inaptemy__ for Joe, because he was inferior.

Usage:

Person 1: "*I just hope they give me an __inaptemy__ so I can win easily!*"

Person 2: "*I know what you mean, but that is unfair to the __inaptemy__.*"
