## Flashy

Definition: A website that has "over the top" styling and
tries to look as fancy as possible. This often crams the website with
too much CSS.

Example: The Simple Dictionary is not __flashy__,
it's simple and lightweight!

Usage:

Person 1: "*Craig, did you just make another __flashy__ website?*"

Person 2(Craig): "*I sure did! Do you like it?*"

Person 1: "*No, can't you just make a simple website?*"

Person 2(Craig): "*Nope, I will never do such a thing.*"
