## Soychat

Definition: Someone who talks too much at gatherings, and leaves after they say to leave or exit
in some way or fashion. Instead of exiting in the requested manner, they start a new
conversation and ignore the impacience of others around them.

Example: Baxy is a __soychat__ because he spent an hour talking with Julia.

Usage: 

Person 1: "*Stop being a __soychat__ and lets go!*"

Person 2: "*No, just leave me be! I don't care that you want to leave,
I care that I want to stay!*"
