# Dassy

Definition: A diligent worker, who is constantly laboring (can be mental or physical, typically mental). It can be good or bad, 
saying you are thankful for the work, or you think they are overworking.

Example: Bill works hard to care for them, and is therefore a __dassy__.

Usage:

Person 1: "*She's such a __dassy__, always so helpful.*"
Person 2: "*You should stop being such a __dassy__; think about yourself once in awhile, you deserve it.*"
