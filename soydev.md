# Soydev 

Definition: A developer who does not follow typical standards to some extent. 

Example: Someone who writes code on a MacBook pro, and always make sure to have all the latest "apple swag" because it's apparently "revolutionary".

Usage:

Person 1: "*Greg is such a __soydev__. He uses a bloated IDE, and codes on his MacBook Pro, and always makes sure to purchase the new model.*"

Person 2: "*Well, at least Mark isn't a __soydev__. Unlike Greg, he uses vim like a professional and runs Linux.*"
