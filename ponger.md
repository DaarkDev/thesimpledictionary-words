# Ponger

Definition: Someone who is "in the dark" about a topic. This could be because they ignore others opinions,
or believe theirs is superior above all others without any logical validation. They are also commonly
"bouncing" their opinion off of you in order to try to make you agree with them.

Example: She was such a __ponger__, she ignored
all of our opinions!

Usage:

Person 1: "*Please stop being a __ponger__. It bothers us that
you never listen to our opinions even just a little.*"

Person 2: "*What? You are ridiculous, I have no such need
to hear opinions from peasants!*"
