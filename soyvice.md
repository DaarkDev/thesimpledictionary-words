# Soyvice

Definition: Someone who presumes all technology to be harmful, and refuses
to learn more about it while making their opinion rather stale.

Example: Margaret is a __soyvice__. She does not let her kids use
any kind of technology, because she believes it spreads ignorance
and "bad culture".

Usage:

Person 1: "*Stop being a __soyvice__. You say that, but you rely on the
internet every day.*"

Person 2: "*Your wrong! The internet is a demon cult that spreads
the devil's fire.*"
