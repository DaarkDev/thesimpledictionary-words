## Slinger

Definition: Someone who is obsessed with athletics, and is often very mean to people
who are not athletic or do not like sports. It is also very common of them to act
rude, bossy, and superior; as if they are trying to be known as the "alpha male".

Example: Aaron is a __slinger__. He bullies nerds, and
is rude to people who do not accept his "superiority".

Usage:

Person 1: "*Please leave me alone, Aaron. Why are __slingers__ so mean?*"

Person 2(Aaron): "*Because I am the alpha male. You aren't good at sports, kid!*"
