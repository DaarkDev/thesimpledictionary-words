## Mocker

Definition: Someone who blames something they did on another person to avoid being
punished or scrutinized.

Example: Aaron is a __mocker__, he blames everything on me
during class so he doesn't get in trouble.

Root: Coming from the word "mockery" or "to mock". This is because
they are practically taunting both the person they are avoiding and the
person that is being blamed.

Usage:

Person 1: "*Come on man, stop being a __mocker__. Why are you blaming
everything on me? So not cool.*"

Person 2(Craig): "*You know how it is, man. Just how we roll.*"
